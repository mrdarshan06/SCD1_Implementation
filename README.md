This repository consist of the files which have we used to implement SCD1 logic in which we used to mysql as the client-DB and used sqoop commands to import the data from the client-DB to the HDFS(Hadoop Distributed File System) to perform analytical operation and SCD1 logic in hive and expoted the data to the clien-DB, where we used shell scripting to automate the process.
